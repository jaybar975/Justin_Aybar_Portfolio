                <p>Greetings, My name is Justin Aybar and I am a Junior at Boulder Creek High School and at
                    Western Maricopa Education Center (West-MEC). I am from Long Island New York. I moved to Anthem
                    Arizona 4 years about which was Feburary 2014. I live with my grandparents and they are the best
                    thing I could ever have in my life. If you see the picture on the left of you you can see that's me
                    and my grandmother on Christmas Eve. I love to code and I love
                    to learn new thing in life!
                    On my off time when I don't have school or work I like to work out, play basketball, practice my
                    coding skills, hangout with family and friends, and finally I LOVE to travel around the world. I
                    love and
                    hangout with friends and family the most!!</p>

                                I do as a Courtesy Clerk is I bag customers groceries and take all the shopping carts
                                from the parking lot and put them back where they belong. Working at Frys is amazing
                                because you get all opportunities. If you start at a low paying department and you
                                work really hard, you can get bumped up to another paying department like the meat,
                                producem deli, and manager department.</p>
